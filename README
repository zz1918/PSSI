# This is the program for achieving the algorithm described in Topology Guaranteed and Error Controlled Curve Tracing for Parametric Surface-Surface Intersection.

# Using Interval/Newton/Ration methods from zz1918's geometric library.

# Main program: PPI.cpp

#How to use this:

#Step 1, turn on linux command lines such as cygwin;
#Step 2, go to the PSSI/build directory;
#Step 3, clear all files in the build directory;
#Step 4, type command "cmake ..";
#Step 5, type command "cmake --build .";
#Step 6, type command "Debug/PPI" to run the tests;
#Step 7, if you want to change the input, go to the PSSI/input directory and change the inputs.js file, which uses json format as input.
